# On the first several lines, until you receive the command "Search", you will receive on separate lines the number as a text and the number as an integer
# When you receive "Search" on the next several lines until you receive the command "Remove", you will be given the searched number as a text, and you need to print it on the console
# When you receive "Remove" on the next several lines until you receive "End", you will be given the searched number as a text, and you need to remove it from the dictionary
# In the end, you need to print what is left from the dictionary
#
# There is some missing code in the solution, and some errors may occur. Complete the code, so the following errors are handled:
# Passing non-integer type to the variable number
# Searching for a non-existent number
# Removing a non-existent number
#
# Print appropriate messages when an error has occurred. The messages should be:
# "The variable number must be an integer"
# "Number does not exist in dictionary" - for non-existing keys
